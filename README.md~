Unbox is a daemon and client library, implemented using CPDistributedMessagingCenter, to make various filesystem operations possible for restricted/sandboxed applications. Having a similar functionality to as of Sandcastle, Unbox makes it possible to actually execute filesystem operations as if under user root. Unbox also doesn't hook into Springboard (as it has a separate daemon), so it won't cause your iPhone's UI to lag or become unresponsive.
